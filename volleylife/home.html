    <p>Originated in Holyoke, Massachussets in 1985. It was created by William G. Morgan and it was thought as a combination of sports like tennis, basketball and handball.The sport was originally called "Mintonette", the name of the sport was later changed during a demonstration game when someone remarked the players looked like they were "volleying" the ball from one side to another. The sport was first included in the Olympic games in 1964 for both men and women categories.Volleyball has had various changes and variations troughout history but the most famous one definitely is Beach Volleyball which eventually became an Olympic Sport in 1996.</p>
